## Zero-Day Attack Detection and Response ‚Äì Cases and Scenarios

### üîç What is a Zero-Day Attack?  
A **Zero-Day Attack** occurs when a security vulnerability is discovered but no official patch or countermeasure has been provided yet, allowing attackers to exploit it.  

Traditional security systems (SIEM, WAF, NDR, etc.) rely on **known attack patterns** (signature and rule-based detection), making it difficult to detect zero-day attacks.  

By utilizing PLURA‚Äôs **web request body log analysis + EDR**, zero-day attacks can be detected and responded to more effectively.
