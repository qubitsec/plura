     PLURA-XDR provides comprehensive SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) functionality, collecting and analyzing security logs from various sources such as networks, hosts, and applications. This enhances efficiency throughout the incident detection, reporting, and response lifecycle, meeting Lv1~Lv3 requirements for incident management processes.  

     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Rapid Incident Identification and Reporting**: Ensures immediate detection and reporting in line with guideline requirements.  
     - ✅ **Improved Response Efficiency**: Reduces false positives through event correlation and supports precise response actions.  

   - **Standardized Response Procedures (Integration with Ticketing and IR Platforms)**:  
     Upon incident detection, PLURA-XDR triggers predefined response playbooks and integrates with ticket management systems or IR (Incident Response) platforms to execute automated or semi-automated actions. Examples include network isolation, account suspension, and IOC (Indicator of Compromise) blocking.  

     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Establishes Structured Response Protocols**: Enhances speed and consistency in incident handling.  
     - ✅ **Minimizes Impact**: Prevents incident escalation with swift action.  

2. **Enhanced Forensic Capabilities**  
   - **Support for Root Cause Analysis Post-Incident**:  
     PLURA-XDR preserves detailed logs and event data, enabling root cause analysis and breach path tracing after incidents occur.  

     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Supports Incident Root Cause Identification and Policy Improvements**: Prevents recurrence by refining security policies.  
     - ✅ **Facilitates PDCA Cycle Execution**: Provides evidence for verification (Check) and improvement (Act) phases.  

   - **Integration with External Forensic Tools**:  
     Refined data generated by PLURA-XDR can be exported to external forensic tools for in-depth analysis. The results can then be referenced in the PLURA-XDR dashboard for subsequent strategy formulation.  

     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Enables Comprehensive Incident Analysis**: Facilitates professional and systematic responses.  
     - ✅ **Maximizes Post-Incident Improvements**: Strengthens preventive measures through continuous improvement.
