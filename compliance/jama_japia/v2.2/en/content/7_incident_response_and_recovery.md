## **7. Incident Response and Recovery**

### (1) Supporting Organizations in Complying with Guidelines and Protecting IT Assets

1. **Integrated SIEM Functionality**  
   - **Efficient Incident Detection, Reporting, and Response**:  
     PLURA-XDR integrates SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) functionalities to collect and analyze security logs from networks, hosts, and applications. This enhances efficiency across the entire process of incident detection, reporting, and response, aligning with Lv1~Lv3 incident management processes.  
     
     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Quick Incident Awareness and Reporting**: Ensures immediate detection and reporting aligned with guideline requirements.  
     - ✅ **Improved Response Efficiency**: Reduces false positives through event correlation and provides precise responses.  

   - **Standardized Response Procedure Integration (External Ticketing and IR Platforms)**:  
     When an incident is detected, PLURA-XDR integrates with predefined playbooks, ticket management systems, or IR (Incident Response) platforms to automate or semi-automate responses. Examples include network isolation, account suspension, and IOC (Indicator of Compromise) blocking.  
     
     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Established Standardized Procedures**: Enhances incident response speed and guideline compliance.  
     - ✅ **Minimized Impact**: Swift actions prevent incident escalation.  

2. **Enhanced Forensic Capabilities**  
   - **Support for Root Cause Analysis After Incidents**:  
     PLURA-XDR preserves detailed logs, event data, various configurations, and system information, supporting forensic analysis to identify root causes and trace intrusion paths after incidents.  
     
     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Supports Root Cause Identification and Policy Improvement**: Enhances security policies to prevent recurrence.  
     - ✅ **Facilitates PDCA Cycles**: Provides evidence for verification (Check) and improvement (Act) stages.  

   - **Integration with External Forensic Tools**:  
     PLURA-XDR generates refined data that can be exported to external forensic tools for in-depth analysis. Results can be referenced within the PLURA-XDR dashboard to refine subsequent response strategies.  
     
     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Supports In-Depth Incident Analysis**: Facilitates structured and professional responses.  
     - ✅ **Maximizes Post-Incident Improvements**: Enables ongoing improvements to prevent future incidents.  

3. **Comprehensive Incident Response via PLURA-XDR Platform**  
   - **PLURA-WAF (Web Application Firewall) for Real-Time Detection and Blocking of Hacking Attempts**:  
     Detects and blocks web-based attacks in real time.  

   - **PLURA-EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) for APT Detection and Blocking**:  
     Provides real-time detection and responses to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) based on MITRE ATT&CK.  

   - **PLURA-SMS (System Monitoring Service) for System Stability Monitoring**:  
     Monitors system stability to proactively identify vulnerabilities.  

   - **PLURA-SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) for Response Support**:  
     Delivers automated user response support for efficient and swift incident management.  

     #### Benefits:
     - ✅ **Comprehensive Incident Response Framework**: Offers an integrated framework leveraging multiple solutions.  
     - ✅ **Enhanced Operational Continuity**: Supports seamless incident detection, response, and recovery.
