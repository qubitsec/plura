## Why Does PLURA-XDR Offer Free Services?

PLURA-XDR believes that all companies, regardless of size, should have access to robust cybersecurity. Therefore, we provide free services to companies that meet certain conditions. The reasons are as follows:

---

1. **Democratization of Information Security**

   Cyber threats pose the same risks to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups as they do to large corporations. However, many smaller companies struggle to adopt high-quality security solutions due to limited budgets. The statistic that **92% of companies affected by hacking attacks are SMEs** is extremely alarming. PLURA-XDR aims to realize the **democratization of information security** by helping these companies operate safely using the latest security technologies.

2. **Partnership for Mutual Growth**

   We strive to **grow together** with our customers. Through our free services, more companies can experience our solutions and recognize the importance of security. This leads to the expansion of the security market and increased awareness of PLURA-XDR in the long term. **Customers can utilize powerful security solutions without financial burden, and we grow alongside a broader customer base.**

3. **Expression of Trust and Confidence**

   By offering services for free, we demonstrate our **exceptional technology and confidence in service quality**. As customers experience the effectiveness of PLURA-XDR firsthand, they build trust, increasing the likelihood of transitioning to paid services or recommending us to other companies. **This provides an opportunity for customers to directly verify how effective our solutions truly are.**

4. **Strengthening Community and Brand Awareness**

   Companies using our free services display `Protected by PLURA` on their websites, forming a security community. This enhances awareness of cybersecurity and contributes to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation. **Additionally, this naturally increases PLURA-XDR's brand recognition, allowing more companies to learn about our solutions.**

5. **Sustainable Business Model**

   While providing free services, PLURA-XDR maintains a **sustainable business model** through paid services and premium features. This allows us to offer the best value to our customers while promoting the company's growth. **We expand our customer base through free services and anticipate a natural transition to premium services in the future.**

## **Why Is Only the PLURA-EDR (Server) Version Offered for Free Among PLURA-XDR Products?**

PLURA-XDR is a platform that integrates various security solutions, and the `PLURA-EDR (Server)` version specializes in endpoint security for server environments.

1. **Importance of Server Security**

   **All hacking attacks ultimately target servers.** Since all of a company's data and core services reside on servers, server security is the cornerstone of corporate security. **Especially, ransomware attacks primarily target servers.** Servers infected with ransomware encrypt critical company data and systems, causing business disruptions and substantial financial losses. **Therefore, the server security provided by PLURA-EDR (Server) is extremely important.** Protecting servers is a top priority for companies, as a breach can lead to catastrophic business losses.

2. **Efficient Edge Computing Technology**

   Technically, the **PLURA-EDR (Server) agent leverages edge computing technology to autonomously perform all detection and analysis.** This minimizes the use of server resources on the PLURA cloud platform, making it **rational from the perspective of PLURA's operational sustainability.** It provides powerful security features without imposing excessive load on the cloud.

3. **Simple Installation and Low Implementation Cost**

   **PLURA-EDR (Server) can be easily applied by simply installing the agent.** It can be introduced immediately without complex configurations or additional infrastructure setup, so **the implementation cost for companies is close to zero.** This helps SMEs enhance server security without financial burden.

For these reasons, PLURA-XDR offers the **PLURA-EDR (Server)** version for free, supporting companies in effectively strengthening their most critical server security.
